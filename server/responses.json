    "openEndedQ1": "We are currently facing difficulties in scaling our infrastructure to support new features and services. There is also a lack of streamlined processes, leading to inefficiencies in cross-functional collaboration. Furthermore, the frequent changes in customer demands require a more agile approach that our current setup doesnâ€™t fully support.",
    "openEndedQ2": "We hope to see a shift towards a more data-driven approach in our decision-making process. Introducing more sophisticated analytics tools would help in better understanding user behavior and preferences. We also want to focus on refining our MVP strategy to validate assumptions earlier in the development cycle, reducing waste and focusing resources on high-impact features.",
    "openEndedQ3": "We recently revamped our user interface, which resulted in a 50% reduction in user churn rate. The success was largely due to conducting in-depth user research and usability testing, allowing us to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience. The project was also a testament to effective collaboration between the design, development, and product management teams.",
    "openEndedQ4": "Customer feedback is primarily collected via NPS surveys and support tickets. We also have a customer advisory board that meets quarterly to provide feedback on new features and future plans. The feedback is documented and tracked using our project management tools, ensuring transparency and accountability in how it influences product decisions."
