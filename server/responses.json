    "openEndedQ1": "The most significant challenge is balancing the need for rapid iteration with maintaining product quality. Our team often feels pressured to release new features quickly, which sometimes compromises thorough testing and quality assurance processes. Additionally, integrating customer feedback into the development cycle in real time remains a hurdle.",
    "openEndedQ2": "Over the next 12 months, we would like to see a stronger emphasis on integrating customer feedback more effectively into the product development cycle. Additionally, increasing the automation of our testing processes could significantly reduce deployment times and improve product quality. We are also looking to implement more agile methodologies to better adapt to market changes.",
    "openEndedQ3": "A recent product development success was the launch of our mobile application, which saw a 40% increase in user engagement within the first three months. This success was primarily due to early involvement of customers in the design phase, allowing us to iterate on feedback rapidly. Our decision to adopt a microservices architecture also enabled more flexibility and faster deployment of updates.",
    "openEndedQ4": "Currently, we gather customer feedback through multiple channels, including surveys, user interviews, and direct feedback forms within the app. This feedback is then analyzed and prioritized by a dedicated customer insights team. Insights gained are discussed in monthly product strategy meetings to ensure alignment with the product roadmap."
