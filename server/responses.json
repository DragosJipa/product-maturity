    "openEndedQ1": "The most significant challenge is balancing the need for rapid iteration with maintaining product quality. Our team often feels pressured to release new features quickly, which sometimes compromises thorough testing and quality assurance processes. Additionally, integrating customer feedback into the development cycle in real time remains a hurdle.",
    "openEndedQ2": "Over the next 12 months, we would like to see a stronger emphasis on integrating customer feedback more effectively into the product development cycle. Additionally, increasing the automation of our testing processes could significantly reduce deployment times and improve product quality. We are also looking to implement more agile methodologies to better adapt to market changes.",
    "openEndedQ3": "We recently revamped our user interface, which resulted in a 50% reduction in user churn rate. The success was largely due to conducting in-depth user research and usability testing, allowing us to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience. The project was also a testament to effective collaboration between the design, development, and product management teams.",
    "openEndedQ4": "Customer feedback is primarily collected via NPS surveys and support tickets. We also have a customer advisory board that meets quarterly to provide feedback on new features and future plans. The feedback is documented and tracked using our project management tools, ensuring transparency and accountability in how it influences product decisions."
