    "openEndedQ1": "Our biggest challenge in product development is the alignment between our development teams and the marketing department. Often, there are conflicting priorities, which delays product launches and impacts the overall product roadmap. Additionally, we struggle with legacy systems that hinder our ability to innovate and quickly pivot based on customer feedback.",
    "openEndedQ2": "We hope to see a shift towards a more data-driven approach in our decision-making process. Introducing more sophisticated analytics tools would help in better understanding user behavior and preferences. We also want to focus on refining our MVP strategy to validate assumptions earlier in the development cycle, reducing waste and focusing resources on high-impact features.",
    "openEndedQ3": "We recently revamped our user interface, which resulted in a 50% reduction in user churn rate. The success was largely due to conducting in-depth user research and usability testing, allowing us to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience. The project was also a testament to effective collaboration between the design, development, and product management teams.",
    "openEndedQ4": "We use a combination of automated feedback collection through in-app surveys and direct outreach programs to gather customer insights. Additionally, we have a beta testing group that provides continuous feedback on upcoming features. This feedback is crucial in refining our development priorities and ensuring we meet our users' needs effectively."
