    "openEndedQ1": "We are currently facing difficulties in scaling our infrastructure to support new features and services. There is also a lack of streamlined processes, leading to inefficiencies in cross-functional collaboration. Furthermore, the frequent changes in customer demands require a more agile approach that our current setup doesnâ€™t fully support.",
    "openEndedQ2": "Over the next 12 months, we would like to see a stronger emphasis on integrating customer feedback more effectively into the product development cycle. Additionally, increasing the automation of our testing processes could significantly reduce deployment times and improve product quality. We are also looking to implement more agile methodologies to better adapt to market changes.",
    "openEndedQ3": "Our successful rollout of a new feature that allowed integration with third-party tools was a significant milestone. It was achieved through a dedicated cross-functional team that worked closely with early adopters to refine the feature before general release. Leveraging an agile framework, the team was able to adapt quickly to changes and feedback, ensuring a smooth deployment.",
    "openEndedQ4": "Currently, we gather customer feedback through multiple channels, including surveys, user interviews, and direct feedback forms within the app. This feedback is then analyzed and prioritized by a dedicated customer insights team. Insights gained are discussed in monthly product strategy meetings to ensure alignment with the product roadmap."
