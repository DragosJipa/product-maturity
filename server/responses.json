    "openEndedQ1": "We are currently facing difficulties in scaling our infrastructure to support new features and services. There is also a lack of streamlined processes, leading to inefficiencies in cross-functional collaboration. Furthermore, the frequent changes in customer demands require a more agile approach that our current setup doesnâ€™t fully support.",
    "openEndedQ2": "We aim to enhance our DevOps practices to achieve continuous delivery and reduce time to market. Another key improvement would be establishing a more transparent communication framework between teams to ensure everyone is aligned on the product vision and goals. Lastly, investing in modernizing our tech stack will be critical for improving overall development efficiency.",
    "openEndedQ3": "We recently revamped our user interface, which resulted in a 50% reduction in user churn rate. The success was largely due to conducting in-depth user research and usability testing, allowing us to create a more intuitive and engaging user experience. The project was also a testament to effective collaboration between the design, development, and product management teams.",
    "openEndedQ4": "Currently, we gather customer feedback through multiple channels, including surveys, user interviews, and direct feedback forms within the app. This feedback is then analyzed and prioritized by a dedicated customer insights team. Insights gained are discussed in monthly product strategy meetings to ensure alignment with the product roadmap."
