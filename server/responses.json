    "openEndedQ1": "The most significant challenge is balancing the need for rapid iteration with maintaining product quality. Our team often feels pressured to release new features quickly, which sometimes compromises thorough testing and quality assurance processes. Additionally, integrating customer feedback into the development cycle in real time remains a hurdle.",
    "openEndedQ2": "We aim to enhance our DevOps practices to achieve continuous delivery and reduce time to market. Another key improvement would be establishing a more transparent communication framework between teams to ensure everyone is aligned on the product vision and goals. Lastly, investing in modernizing our tech stack will be critical for improving overall development efficiency.",
    "openEndedQ3": "A recent product development success was the launch of our mobile application, which saw a 40% increase in user engagement within the first three months. This success was primarily due to early involvement of customers in the design phase, allowing us to iterate on feedback rapidly. Our decision to adopt a microservices architecture also enabled more flexibility and faster deployment of updates.",
    "openEndedQ4": "We use a combination of automated feedback collection through in-app surveys and direct outreach programs to gather customer insights. Additionally, we have a beta testing group that provides continuous feedback on upcoming features. This feedback is crucial in refining our development priorities and ensuring we meet our users' needs effectively.",
