    "openEndedQ1": "Our biggest challenge in product development is the alignment between our development teams and the marketing department. Often, there are conflicting priorities, which delays product launches and impacts the overall product roadmap. Additionally, we struggle with legacy systems that hinder our ability to innovate and quickly pivot based on customer feedback.",
    "openEndedQ2": "We hope to see a shift towards a more data-driven approach in our decision-making process. Introducing more sophisticated analytics tools would help in better understanding user behavior and preferences. We also want to focus on refining our MVP strategy to validate assumptions earlier in the development cycle, reducing waste and focusing resources on high-impact features.",
    "openEndedQ3": "A recent product development success was the launch of our mobile application, which saw a 40% increase in user engagement within the first three months. This success was primarily due to early involvement of customers in the design phase, allowing us to iterate on feedback rapidly. Our decision to adopt a microservices architecture also enabled more flexibility and faster deployment of updates.",
    "openEndedQ4": "We use a combination of automated feedback collection through in-app surveys and direct outreach programs to gather customer insights. Additionally, we have a beta testing group that provides continuous feedback on upcoming features. This feedback is crucial in refining our development priorities and ensuring we meet our users' needs effectively."
